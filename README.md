URL-shortener

This was a project developed for the online course "DÃ©veloppez votre site web avec le framework Django" offered by OpenClassrooms.

It is a web site that displays a form enabling to type an URL and it automatically converts it in a shorter version using a random code, which is useful in sites like Twitter where only 140 characters are allowed, so it's not possible to type long URLs.

The form has just two fields: the URL and the pseudo of the user, which can be left blank.

The main page displays all the URLs registered that were already shortened and a link that redirects to the form to shorten a new URL.
